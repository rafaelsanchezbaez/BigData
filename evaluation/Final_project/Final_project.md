## Theoretical framework of algorithms
#### Support vector machine (SVM)
Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used in many classification and regression problems, including medical signal processing, natural language processing, and image and speech recognition applications.
The goal of the SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane that best separates two different classes of data points. "As best as possible" implies the hyperplane with the widest margin between the two classes, represented by the plus and minus signs in the figure below. The margin is defined as the maximum width of the region parallel to the hyperplane that has no interior data points. The algorithm can only find this hyperplane in problems that allow linear separation; in most practical problems, the algorithm maximizes the soft margin by allowing a small number of misclassifications.[3]

 #### Decision tree
 A decision tree is a graphical and analytical way of representing all the events (happenings) that can arise from a decision made at a certain moment. They help us make the most "right" decision, from a probabilistic point of view, given a range of possible decisions. These trees allow you to examine the results and visually determine how the model flows. Visual results help look for specific subgroups and relationships that we might not find with more traditional statisticians.
Decision trees are a statistical technique for segmentation, stratification, prediction, data reduction and variable filtering, interaction identification, category merging, and discretization of continuous variables[5].
